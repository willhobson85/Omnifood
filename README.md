## About The Project

After creating my portfolio with a responsive design, I wanted to learn more about UI design and responsive webpages. Since I was just wanting to learn some basics, I decided to use plain HTML and CSS for this repo.

## Project Spec

The goals of this app was to:

- Learn more about responsive design for different size screens
- Learn about visual hierarchy
- Have fun working with the basics

## Reflections

For this project, I focused on web design before mobile, which is the opposite of what I did with my portfolio. I really learned a lot about web design in this project, including visual hierarchy, layout, and color design. I also had not used Netlify to deploy a page before, but it was very easy to use, and I was able to set up a custom landing page, if anyone fills out the form.
